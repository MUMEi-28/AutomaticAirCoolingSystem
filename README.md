# Automatic Air Cooling System

This project demonstrates an **Automatic Cooling System** that monitors environmental conditions using a DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor) and controls a cooling device (fan) based on predefined thresholds. The system displays real-time data on an LCD screen and is implemented using an Arduino Uno board.

### Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of temperature (Â°C) and humidity (%)
- Automatic activation of a cooling fan when temperature exceeds a set limit
- Visual feedback via 16x2 LCD display

## Design and Simulation

To ensure proper planning and functionality before hardware implementation, the system was first designed and simulated using ðŸ§© Excalidraw and ðŸ”Œ Cirkit Designer IDE.
